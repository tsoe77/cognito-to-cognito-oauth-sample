# Example Amazon Cognito to Amazon Cognito Federated Authentication

## How it works

Following is a high level architecture diagram of this solution.

![Cognito High Level Architecture Diagram](./docs/assets/cognito_highlevel.png)

- App1 uses Amazon Cognito Pool1 to login

![App1 Login Page](./docs/assets/app1_login.png)

- App2 uses Amazon Cognito Pool2 to login
- App2 has an option to login using App1
  - When App2 login using App1, it is configured to take you to Cognito Hosted UI of App1 to login
  - Upon successful login, it will redirect back to App2

### Validation

- Signed up a user using Cognito Pool1 in App1 and able to login to App1

- Signed up a user using Cognito Pool2 in App2 and able to login to App2
- Login to App2 with Sign in with App1 option

## Terraform

Everything you need to set it up in AWS are in the `terraform` directory.

`terraform apply` would create two Amazon Cognito pools with app clients and OIDC provider on Cognito Pool2.

Terraform outputs contains neccessary details for the Web Apps. Run `terraform output` to see the output.

```sh
Outputs:

app1 = {
  "app1_client1_id" = "123abc"
  "user_pool_id" = "eu-west-1_123456"
}
app2 = {
  "app2_client1_id" = "abc123"
  "app2_provider_id" = "eu-west-1_234567:app1"
  "app2_oauth_domain" = "xxxxx.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com"
  "user_pool_id" = "eu-west-1_234567"
}
```

As of creation:

## Web Apps

Two webs are created for demonstration purposes only. They are in the `webapps` directory. You need to configure the Cognito details in the `webapps/app1/src/main.js` and `webapps/app2/src/main.js` for it to work.

Running this will just launch the app. Ports are configured statically. App1 uses TCP port 8001 and App2 uses TCP port 8002.

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```
